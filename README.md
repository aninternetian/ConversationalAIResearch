**>Channel interactions**  
Synchronous Channels - on demand conversations  
Asynchronous Channels - Typically resumed by a customer

**>What is Conversational AI**
- Incorporate context, personalization, and relevance within human to computer interaction
- Provides human-like communications by recognizing speech and text, understanding intent, deciphering different languages, and responding in a way that mimics human conversation.

*How does it work?*  
Uses various technologies such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Dialog management, and Machine Learning to communicate with humans at a human level.

**>Conversational AI at a glance**  
*ASR* - Listening  
Voice recognition.  
Translates spoken words into machine readable format or text  

*Natural Language Understanding (NLU)* - Comprehending  
Part of NLP.  
Deciphers meaning of text to understand intent.  

*Dialog Management* - Forming response  
Forms the response based on its understanding of text’s intent using Dialog Management  

*Natural Language Generation (NLG)* - Offering response  
Part of NLP.  
Dialog management orchestrates responses, and converts them into human understandable format. Response in text or artificial voice.  

*Machine Learning* - Learning  
Uses reinforced learning by accepting corrections and learning from the experience to deliver a better response in future interactions
